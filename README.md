## Projects for Term 1

### SpaceGame

This is my first project in Game Development 1â€”a 2D space shooter game that introduces core gameplay mechanics such as movement, shooting, upgrades, and enemy interactions. The player controls a spaceship navigating through space while dodging and destroying incoming asteroids.

The objective is to survive waves of asteroids while strategically managing health and ammunition. As the game progresses, players can collect health packs and ammo upgrades that spawn throughout the game, enhancing their survivability and firepower.
